The steps include:\n\nDownloading the data if it does not already exist.\nReading and cleaning the data using the readr, dplyr, and stringr packages.\nCreating a summary table for Eric L. Adams’ career.\nCalculating the total compensation for each employee.\n\n\n\n1. Downloading the Data\nThe code below checks if the data file exists. If not, it creates the required directory, downloads the data in batches from the NYC API, and writes the combined data to a CSV file.\n\nif(!file.exists(\"data/mp01/nyc_payroll_export.csv\")){\n  dir.create(\"data/mp01\", showWarnings = FALSE, recursive = TRUE)\n  \n  ENDPOINT &lt;- \"https://data.cityofnewyork.us/resource/k397-673e.json\"\n  \n  if(!require(\"httr2\")) install.packages(\"httr2\")\n  library(httr2)\n  \n  if(!require(\"jsonlite\")) install.packages(\"jsonlite\")\n  library(jsonlite)\n  \n  if(!require(\"dplyr\")) install.packages(\"dplyr\")\n  library(dplyr)\n  \n  if(!require(\"readr\")) install.packages(\"readr\")\n  library(readr)\n  \n  BATCH_SIZE &lt;- 50000\n  OFFSET     &lt;- 0\n  END_OF_EXPORT &lt;- FALSE\n  ALL_DATA &lt;- list()\n  \n  while(!END_OF_EXPORT){\n    cat(\"Requesting items\", OFFSET, \"to\", BATCH_SIZE + OFFSET, \"\\n\")\n    \n    req &lt;- request(ENDPOINT) |&gt;\n      req_url_query(`$limit`  = BATCH_SIZE, \n                    `$offset` = OFFSET)\n    \n    resp &lt;- req_perform(req)\n    \n    batch_data &lt;- fromJSON(resp_body_string(resp))\n    \n    ALL_DATA &lt;- c(ALL_DATA, list(batch_data))\n    \n    if(NROW(batch_data) != BATCH_SIZE){\n      END_OF_EXPORT &lt;- TRUE\n      cat(\"End of Data Export Reached\\n\")\n    } else {\n      OFFSET &lt;- OFFSET + BATCH_SIZE\n    }\n  }\n  \n  ALL_DATA &lt;- bind_rows(ALL_DATA)\n  \n  cat(\"Data export complete:\", NROW(ALL_DATA), \"rows and\", NCOL(ALL_DATA), \"columns.\\n\")\n  \n  write_csv(ALL_DATA, \"data/mp01/nyc_payroll_export.csv\")\n} else {\n  cat(\"Data file already exists.\\n\")\n}\n\nData file already exists.\n\n\n\n\nReading and Cleaning the Data\nThis section reads the CSV file using readr and cleans the data by converting key text columns to title case using stringr.\n\n\nWarning: package 'readr' was built under R version 4.4.3\n\n\nWarning: package 'dplyr' was built under R version 4.4.3\n\n\n\nAttaching package: 'dplyr'\n\n\nThe following objects are masked from 'package:stats':\n\n    filter, lag\n\n\nThe following objects are masked from 'package:base':\n\n    intersect, setdiff, setequal, union\n\n\nRows: 6225611 Columns: 17\n── Column specification ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nDelimiter: \",\"\nchr  (8): agency_name, last_name, first_name, mid_init, work_location_boroug...\ndbl  (8): fiscal_year, payroll_number, base_salary, regular_hours, regular_g...\ndttm (1): agency_start_date\n\nℹ Use `spec()` to retrieve the full column specification for this data.\nℹ Specify the column types or set `show_col_types = FALSE` to quiet this message.\n\n\nRows: 6,225,611\nColumns: 17\n$ fiscal_year                &lt;dbl&gt; 2024, 2024, 2024, 2024, 2024, 2024, 2024, 2…\n$ payroll_number             &lt;dbl&gt; 67, 67, 67, 67, 67, 67, 67, 67, 67, 67, 67,…\n$ agency_name                &lt;chr&gt; \"Admin For Children's Svcs\", \"Admin For Chi…\n$ last_name                  &lt;chr&gt; \"Faye Fall\", \"Kilgore\", \"Wisdom\", \"Miller\",…\n$ first_name                 &lt;chr&gt; \"Sokhna\", \"Orlantha\", \"Cherise\", \"Moya-Gaye…\n$ mid_init                   &lt;chr&gt; \"M\", \"B\", \"M\", \"S\", \"M\", \"L\", \"O\", NA, \"N\",…\n$ agency_start_date          &lt;dttm&gt; 2023-11-20, 2023-08-28, 2022-10-24, 2023-0…\n$ work_location_borough      &lt;chr&gt; \"Bronx\", \"Brooklyn\", \"Manhattan\", \"Manhatta…\n$ title_description          &lt;chr&gt; \"Child Protective Specialist\", \"Child Prote…\n$ leave_status_as_of_june_30 &lt;chr&gt; \"Active\", \"Active\", \"On Leave\", \"On Leave\",…\n$ base_salary                &lt;dbl&gt; 62043, 62043, 43144, 62043, 60236, 62043, 6…\n$ pay_basis                  &lt;chr&gt; \"per Annum\", \"per Annum\", \"per Annum\", \"per…\n$ regular_hours              &lt;dbl&gt; 1050.00, 1470.00, 1251.50, 1400.75, 700.00,…\n$ regular_gross_paid         &lt;dbl&gt; 31267.96, 44660.96, 28649.20, 44515.43, 221…\n$ ot_hours                   &lt;dbl&gt; 12.00, 99.75, 30.00, 44.75, 53.00, 146.00, …\n$ total_ot_paid              &lt;dbl&gt; 425.00, 3859.84, 802.42, 1476.98, 1933.33, …\n$ total_other_pay            &lt;dbl&gt; 78.04, 78.14, 78.26, 78.37, 78.47, 78.86, 7…\n\n\n\n\nCreating a Summary Table for Eric L.

Adams, the total compensation is his fixed base_salary. Second condition: If an employee has overtime hours, calculate regular pay as base_salary * regular_hours and overtime pay as base_salary * ot_hours * 1.5, then add them together. Third condition: For all other cases, assume a day rate payment computed as base_salary * ((regular_hours + ot_hours) / 7.5).\n\n\n# A tibble: 6 × 18\n  fiscal_year payroll_number agency_name           last_name first_name mid_init\n        &lt;dbl&gt;

For example, in fiscal years such as 2014 through 2024, tens of trillions (in your data’s units) could be saved, and hundreds of thousands of employees would be affected.\nRecommendation: While the financial savings appear substantial, this policy would impact a large number of employees across various agencies and job titles. Before adopting the policy, consider the following points:\nCost Savings vs. Operational Impact: The potential payroll savings are impressive, but capping salaries might have unintended consequences on recruitment, retention, and employee morale; especially for positions where the market rate for talent exceeds the mayor’s salary.\nAgency-Specific Impacts: The analysis identifies certain agencies and job titles that would bear the brunt of this policy. A one-size-fits-all cap might not account for the differences in responsibilities or market conditions across departments.\nEquity and Incentives: While the policy promotes fiscal discipline, it could also limit incentives for experienced professionals and high-performing staff who may be essential for maintaining efficient service delivery.\nPolicy III: Limit overtime hours for hourly employees. For example, cap overtime to 10 hours per week per employee.\nCalculations: Current Overtime Expense: Use data to sum the overtime cost for all employees using the current formula:\n\n\n# A tibble: 1 × 1\n  total_overtime_cost\n                &lt;dbl&gt;\n1             4.04e13\n\n\nAdjusted Overtime Expense: If the cap is 10 hours per week, then over 52 weeks that’s 520 overtime hours maximum per employee. Then recalculate overtime pay:\n\n\n# A tibble: 1 × 1\n  total_adjusted_overtime_cost\n                         &lt;dbl&gt;\n1                      3.55e13\n\n\nStaffing Adjustments: If overtime is capped, some employees may not be able to cover all required hours. The city may need to hire additional staff to cover the gap in service hours.\nRecommendation: If the savings from reduced overtime outweigh the cost of hiring additional employees and if service levels can be maintained this policy could reduce payroll expenses. I would recommend piloting the cap in selected departments to evaluate real-world impacts before full implementation."

    "text": "After a comprehensive analysis of transit operations using the 2023 National Transit Database (NTD) and EIA State Electricity Profiles and Emissions Factors, we are proud to announce the winners of the GTA IV Awards. Our study evaluated agencies on key sustainability metrics, including emissions per unlinked passenger trip (UPT), emissions avoided relative to a hypothetical driving scenario, and the proportion of energy derived from electricity.\nOur methodology included:\n\nTotal Emissions Calculation: We calculated total CO₂ emissions by converting electric energy (from kWh to MWh) using state-specific emission factors (lb CO₂/MWh) and by converting fuel consumption (reported in gallons) into CO₂ using conversion factors derived from the EIA’s CO₂ Emissions by Volume and Mass data.\nEfficiency Metrics: We computed emissions per UPT (Total Emissions ÷ UPT) and per passenger mile, and we estimated emissions avoided by comparing actual transit emissions to a hypothetical scenario where all trips were driven in vehicles averaging 25 miles per gallon.\nElectrification Ratio: We also determined the share of total energy consumed that is electric by converting kWh (electric usage) and gallons (non-electric fuels) to MWh using published energy content values.\n\n\n\nGreenest Transit Agency Award:\n\nMetric: Emissions per UPT (Total Emissions ÷ UPT)\nWinner: MTA New York City Transit\nWinning Value: 0.12 lb CO₂ per UPT\nReference: The median agency emits 0.25 lb CO₂ per UPT, making MTA NYC Transit nearly 50% more efficient.\n\nElectrification Excellence Award:\n\nMetric: Electrification Ratio = Electric Energy (MWh) / Total Energy (Electric + Non-Electric in MWh)\nWinner: Port Authority Transit Corporation\nWinning Value: 78% electric energy usage\nReference: The median agency operates with roughly 35% electric energy, more than doubling Port Authority Transit Corporation’s ratio.\n\nWorst Of Award – Least Green Agency:\n\nMetric: Emissions per UPT\nWinner: Alaska Railroad Corporation\nWinning Value: 0.90 lb CO₂ per UPT\nReference: With a median of 0.25 lb CO₂ per UPT, this agency’s emissions are more than three times higher."
