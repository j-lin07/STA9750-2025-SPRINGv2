<h1>Executive Summary</h1>
<p>After a comprehensive analysis of transit operations using the 2023 National Transit Database (NTD) and EIA State Electricity Profiles and Emissions Factors, we are proud to announce the winners of the GTA IV Awards. Our study evaluated agencies on key sustainability metrics, including emissions per unlinked passenger trip (UPT), emissions avoided relative to a hypothetical driving scenario, and the proportion of energy derived from electricity.</p>
<p>Our methodology included:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Total Emissions Calculation: We calculated total CO₂ emissions by converting electric energy (from kWh to MWh) using state-specific emission factors (lb CO₂/MWh) and by converting fuel consumption (reported in gallons) into CO₂ using conversion factors derived from the EIA’s CO₂ Emissions by Volume and Mass data.</p></li>
<li><p>Efficiency Metrics: We computed emissions per UPT (Total Emissions ÷ UPT) and per passenger mile, and we estimated emissions avoided by comparing actual transit emissions to a hypothetical scenario where all trips were driven in vehicles averaging 25 miles per gallon.</p></li>
<li><p>Electrification Ratio: We also determined the share of total energy consumed that is electric by converting kWh (electric usage) and gallons (non-electric fuels) to MWh using published energy content values.</p></li>
</ul>
<section id="key-findings" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="key-findings">Key Findings</h2>
<p>Greenest Transit Agency Award:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Metric: Emissions per UPT (Total Emissions ÷ UPT)</p></li>
<li><p>Winner: MTA New York City Transit</p></li>
<li><p>Winning Value: 0.12 lb CO₂ per UPT</p></li>
<li><p>Reference: The median agency emits 0.25 lb CO₂ per UPT, making MTA NYC Transit nearly 50% more efficient.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Electrification Excellence Award:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Metric: Electrification Ratio = Electric Energy (MWh) / Total Energy (Electric + Non-Electric in MWh)</p></li>
<li><p>Winner: Port Authority Transit Corporation</p></li>
<li><p>Winning Value: 78% electric energy usage</p></li>
<li><p>Reference: The median agency operates with roughly 35% electric energy, more than doubling Port Authority Transit Corporation’s ratio.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Worst Of Award – Least Green Agency:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Metric: Emissions per UPT</p></li>
<li><p>Winner: Alaska Railroad Corporation</p></li>
<li><p>Winning Value: 0.90 lb CO₂ per UPT</p></li>
<li><p>Reference: With a median of 0.25 lb CO₂ per UPT, this agency’s emissions are more than three times higher.</p></li>

<section id="downloading-the-data" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="downloading-the-data">Downloading the data</h2>
<p>We began by aggregating the joined dataset at the agency level. Because transit usage is reported at the agency level, we summed the emissions across multiple modes for each agency and then computed key efficiency metrics</p>
